# Comixly

There was no way to export your ccollection from Comixology as a csv, so I made one.

Yes, I know the Comixology site is soon to be killed by Amazon. This is why I wanted my collection in a csv format.

To keep track of which comics I'd been able to download as DRM-free files and which ones I hadn't.

Comixly assumes there's a html folder and that it contains html files. Those html files need to contain copies of the DOM tree of https://www.comixology.eu/my-books/library/_/btitleASC/1 and subsequent pages.

This was always meant to be a quick, temporary kludge to get me the data I needed. I know it's not pretty ur user friendly.
